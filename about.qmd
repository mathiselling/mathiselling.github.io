Hello! I am Mathis Elling, a researcher at the Institute for Quality Assurance in Prevention and Rehabilitation at the German Sport University Cologne ([iqpr](https://iqpr.de/)). I am trained at University of Twente (BSc) and Maastricht University (MSc, PhD). My research revolves around health psychology, with a focus on behavior change in the context of prevention and rehabilitation. I am interested in data science using R and Python.
